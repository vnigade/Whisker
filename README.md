CNCR lab at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam have developed a behavioral apparatus (hardware) in which rats perform a pre-learned, well-defined behavior while we record from single and ensembles of cortical neurons with high temporal precision.  
I wrote a software to control various hardware modules (linear actuators, TTL I/Os) along with the front-end GUI. Gave GUI based scripting ability (including programming constructs like loops, threads etc). The software helps the experimenter to control and fine-tune the operational characteristics of our behavioral apparatus.
